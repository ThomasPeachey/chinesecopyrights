		<p> Intellectual property rights have been acknowledged and protected in China. China has acceded to the major international conventions on protection of rights to intellectual property. Domestically, protection of intellectual property law has also been established by government legislation, administrative regulations, and decrees in the areas of copyright, trademark, and patent. This has led to the creation of a legal framework to protect intellectual property. IPR enforcement is improving, but significant challenges remain. Laws in place are not well enforced. IPR protections has increased in the past five years and will continue to do so. A solution would be to try to create organizations that better enforce the laws, such as the DMCA in the United States. </p>
